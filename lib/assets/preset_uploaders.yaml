# This YAML file contains upload presets for various services.
# Each preset includes configurations for uploading files, such as URLs, parameters,
# headers, and request methods.
#
# Each preset is represented as a mapping and includes the following fields:
#   - RequestURL*: The URL to which the file will be uploaded
#   - FileFormName*: The name of the form field where the file will be attached
#   - UseByes*: A boolean indicating whether to use bytes for file upload
#   - Headers: Additional headers to include in the request
#   - Parameters: Additional parameters to include in the request
#   - Arguments: Additional arguments for the request (form data)
#   - URLResponse: How the app should parse the returned url from the server. Custom Uploader will 
#     attempt to get the returned url automatically, but some services may break up the returned url, 
#     in which case this field should be used
#   - ErrorResponse: How the app should parse the error returned from the server in case the upload
#     failed
#   - RequestMethod*: The HTTP request method to use (POST, PUT, GET, PATCH)
#
# Each preset may have a different set of fields depending on the service.
# Additionally, fields marked with an "*" are required.
#
# Feel free to contribute more presets by following the same structure :)
